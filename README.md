# Bucket-List

Bucket List App is a powerful app which allows you to create and manage a list of things
to do before you die! The phrase "Bucket List" originates from the idiomatic expression
"kick the bucket", which means to die, to decease. For that reason Bucket List is a list of
what should be done before you die. More specifically it is a checklist of what you want
to see, try, do and feel in your life. And there is only one chance and that chance is your
life. Bucket List is an app that helps people not only to put together their bucket list, but
to also go about doing what's required to realize their dreams. We all have mental bucket
lists, but few of us are able to actually make much headway into them. The Bucket List
app helps people break up items in their bucket lists into specific goals. In doing so, the
app inspires and motivates people to do what's necessary to start living the dream instead
of dreaming it. All of that sounds well and good, but at the end of the day one needs to
access specific goods and services to help them realize bucket list items. The Bucket List
app helps with that, connecting people to services and products that are pertinent to their
bucket list items. In other words, the Bucket List app doesn't just walk the walk, it
actually talks the talk by helping you truly narrow down what needs to be done to go
snowmobiling in Antarctica or climb Mount Everest
